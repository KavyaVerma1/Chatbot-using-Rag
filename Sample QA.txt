Q5) "How did Albus Dumbledore die? explain in detail"

OUTPUT: Albus Dumbledore died after being struck by a curse cast by Severus Snape on the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. However, it was a pre-arranged plan between Dumbledore and Snape to make it appear as though Snape had turned against Dumbledore, in order to protect Draco Malfoy's soul and to further the ultimate plan to defeat Voldemort.

According to the context, when Dumbledore was attacked, Harry was present and was horrified by the event. Dumbledore sank onto the ground, and Harry tried to comfort him, saying that he would be all right. However, Dumbledore knew that his time was coming to an end and asked for Professor Snape, indicating that he had made arrangements with Snape beforehand.

It is not explicitly stated in the provided context how Dumbledore's death occurred in detail, but based on the Harry Potter book series by J.K. Rowling, it is known that Dumbledore was killed by Snape's curse, but only because Dumbledore had asked Snape to end his life if necessary, in order to spare Draco's soul from being damaged by committing the murder himself, and to maintain Snape's cover as a double agent.
